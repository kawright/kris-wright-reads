## Part 1: We "Other Victorians"

[3] We used to support a Victorian regime, and its effects are still felt 
today.

[3] Our sexuality is defined by the *imperial prude*: restrained, mute, and
hypocritical.

[3] Society in the early seventeenth century used to be much less conservative
in its concept of sexuality than in the nineteenth century. Bodies *"made a
display of themselves."*

[3] Sex became redefined as *in the home* and for the *serious function of
reproduction*.

[3] The *legitimate and procreative* couple became the sole owner of the 
right to express human sexuality.

[3] The restriction of sexuality to the couple was enforced both in public
(*social space*) and private (*heart of every household*).

[4] Speech and behavior not *ordered in terms of generation or 
transfigured[^1] by it* was banned from public and private discourse entirely.

[4] Victorian sexuality was not *prohibited*, but rather *repressed*. Which
is to say, not stopped upon evident display, but unaffirmed in its existence
altogether. "nothing to say... nothing to see... nothing to know" about it.

[4] Where allowances for *illegitimate sexualities* were made, it was to be
done in institutions and markets--mental hospitals and brothel houses--where 
their reality--and by extension a *clandesine, circumscribed, and coded* form
of discourse--could authorized at a *going rate*.

[4] The purveyors of these places, the *prostitute, the client, and the pimp*,
as well as the *psychiatrist and his hysteric*, are what Steven Marcus would
call the *Other Victorians*.

[5] We still, as of the time of writing (1970s), have barely gotten over this
extended period of sexual repression at a societal level.

[5] Freud's contributions to the advancement of sexual discourse remained
circumspect and medically sanitized and clinicalized--whispering *between the
couch and discourse*.

[5] Repression is *the fundamental link between power, knowledge, and
sexuality*.

[5] Due to the link between exercized societal power and repression, sexual
liberation inherently involves the transgression of laws and the denouncement
of the Other Victorians who hold non-conformist sex hostage at the marketplace.

[5] The foreclosing of free sexual expression in the seventeenth century
coincides with the advent of capitalism.

[5] Sexual repression is *an integral part of the bourgeois order.*

[5] There is a link between the *minor chronicle of sex* and the *history of 
the modes of production*.

[6] Sex is repressed as such because of its incompatibility with the intensity
of subjugation required of capitalism.
